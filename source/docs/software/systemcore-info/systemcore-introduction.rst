The Limelight Systemcore is designed specifically with FIRST in mind. The Systemcore is powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5), and uses a Raspberry Pi RP2050 for reconfigurable I/O.

The Systemcore is a reconfigurable robotics controller that includes built-in ports for Controller Area Network (CAN), Inter-Integrated Circuits (I2C), USB, Ethernet, and reconfigurable I/O for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Digital I/O, and Analog Input to quickly connect the common sensors and actuators used in robotics. The controller features LEDs, a display, and an onboard IMU. It has an onboard quad-core ARM real-time Cortexâ€‘A76 processor.

Detailed information on the systemcore can be found in the [Systemcore technical specifications](https://downloads.limelightvision.io/documents/systemcore_specifications_june15_2025_alpha.pdf).
